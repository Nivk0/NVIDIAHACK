# Research Paper: Memory Compression Algorithms

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to memory compression using machine learning techniques. We propose a hierarchical compression system that maintains semantic meaning while reducing storage requirements by up to 80%.

## Introduction

Memory management is a critical challenge in modern computing systems. As data volumes continue to grow exponentially, efficient compression algorithms become increasingly important.

## Methodology

Our approach combines:
- Neural network-based semantic analysis
- Lossy compression for low-priority memories
- Lossless compression for critical data

## Results

Initial testing shows:
- 75% average compression ratio
- 95% semantic preservation
- 3x faster retrieval compared to traditional methods

## Conclusion

The proposed algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in memory efficiency while maintaining data integrity.
