Photo Description: Family Vacation 2018

This is a photo from our family vacation to the Grand Canyon in 2018. 
The photo shows all of us standing at the edge of the South Rim.

People in photo:
- Mom and Dad
- My sister Sarah
- Me
- Our dog Max

The weather was perfect that day - sunny and clear. We spent the whole 
day hiking and taking in the amazing views. This was one of our best 
family trips ever.

The photo is a bit blurry because someone was holding the camera, but 
it captures a great memory. We should probably get a better copy 
scanned or retake a similar photo on our next visit.
